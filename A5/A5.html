        <li class="B">External - by using a link elements to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li class="B">The most common way to add CSS is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However <span> <mark style="color:#933333 ; font-size:large" >in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</mark></span>,because this is easier to demonstrate, and easire for you to try it yourself.</li>
